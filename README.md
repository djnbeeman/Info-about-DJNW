### Hello Yall👋🏻

<!--
**djnbeeman/Info-about-DJNW is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub
profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🖌 I am trying to be a artist.
- 📮 the way to find me is: DNichols™#5033.
- 📝 just a little fun fact I can do roleplays and stuff as long as it's completely appropiate.
- 😀 My gender is male.
- 🗨 ask me something if it's important.
- ⚒ I work on some mods.
- 🤝🏻 Collabration will be allowed as long as they make me comfortable in a way.
- 🔭 I am looking for a composer for all the mods I work on.
